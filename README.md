# CSE 341: Personal Project Two
A simple, Heroku-deployable Express "Hello, world"

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create a .env file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Start the application: `npm start`

## Developing
Use the `watch` script to hot-reload the server as code changes.

This script also runs node with the inspector agent enabled. To
set breakpoints visit chrome://inspect and run the dedicated
node debugging tools.
